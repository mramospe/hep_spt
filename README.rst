Introduction
============

The High Energy Physics Statistics and Plotting Tools package provides tools to work in High Energy Physics using general python packages.

This package is meant to be used together with:

  * Samples are preferred as structured numpy.ndarray or pandas.DataFrame objects.
  * Plotting functions and classes are designed to work with matplotlib.
  * Statistical tools are built on top of the standard scipy package.

Find the full documentation for the package in the `GitHub Pages <https://mramospe.github.io/hep_spt/>`_.
